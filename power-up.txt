* I/O:
 - Voltage: 3.3V 
 - Cells: VDD_POC_IO, VDD_IO, VSS_IO
* Core:
 - Voltage: 1.2V
 - Cells: VDD_CORE, VSS_CORE

Auszug aus dem TSMC Manual:
Turn on the higher (I/O) voltage first and then the lower (core) voltage:
PVDD2POC cell would general POC signal to have the output NMOS and
PMOS buffers off, so that the crowbar current in the post-driver fingers
would not occur on the power-up stage.
